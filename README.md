Caesar Cipher in Cryptography.
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”.
Write down the plaintext message: HELLO
Choose a shift value. In this case, we will use a shift of 3.
Replace each letter in the plaintext message with the letter that is three positions to the right in the alphabet.
       { H becomes K (shift 3 from H)
        E becomes H (shift 3 from E)
        L becomes O (shift 3 from L)
        L becomes O (shift 3 from L)}
